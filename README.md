## Luigi E-Commerce Application

This is a beta e-commerce web application which was implemented by Luigi(React).

* There are two microfront views (Products, Details) implemented in Luigi framework.
* User is able to see all available products.
* User is able to navigate to product details page while selecting a product from list.

## TODO
This is a very brief list of things that I would love to work on given more time:
* Apply the best practice on Luigi settings (luigi-config.js)
* Use [fundamental Library for React](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-react) instead of css directly
* Increase unit test coverage
* Improve UI/UX
